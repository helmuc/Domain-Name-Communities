This repository contains a curated list of **domain name forums** from around the world.  
These communities bring together **domain investors, registrars, registries, brokers, developers, and entrepreneurs** to discuss domain names, share industry knowledge, and trade digital assets.  

The list is sorted by **established date** and divided into three categories:
- **Active Forums** ‚Äì currently running communities  
- **Empty Startup Forums** ‚Äì newly created forums with little to no activity yet  
- **Dead / Closed Forums** ‚Äì forums that no longer resolve or are inactive
