A repositary where I keep lists of domain name forums, social groups and communities organized in separate .md files. These communities connect domain investors, registrars, registries, brokers, developers, and entrepreneurs to trade domains, share knowledge, and collaborate.

ðŸ‘‰ **Domain Name Forums:** [`Domain-Name-Forums-list.md`](Domain-Name-Forums-list.md)

ðŸ‘‰ **Domain Name Categories at Popular Forums:** [Domain-Name-Categories-at-Popular-Forums.md](https://github.com/helmuc/Domain-Name-Communities/blob/main/Domain-Name-Categories-at-Popular-Forums.md)

## About

The lists are maintained by me. My name is Helmuts, and I am a proud owner of DNForum.com, AcornDomains.co.uk, ConsultDomain.de and a number of other forums of different sizes, ages and activities.

Our trademark: we don't allow insulting other members and other businesses and brands on our forums. You visit our forums happy, and leave happy.

I believe that forums are one of the least valued online properies and can be run as sucessful small businesses. 99.9% of my business contacts politely smile about this - I make $$ that allows me to have a basic freedom.
