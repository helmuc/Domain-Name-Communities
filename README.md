## About
This repo focuses on **forums** (message-board style communities). Marketplaces, newsletters, Discord/Telegram groups, or one-off social groups arenâ€™t included unless they have a persistent forum component.

Lists in the full file are split into:
- **Active Forums** â€“ currently running communities
- **Empty Startup Forums** â€“ new forums with minimal activity
- **Dead / Closed Forums** â€“ no longer resolving or inactive

All tables are sorted by **Est. year** (ascending) for quick historical context.

## Whatâ€™s Inside
